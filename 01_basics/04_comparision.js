//Comparision Operators 

// console.log( 2 > 1 );   //2 is greater than 1
// console.log( 2 >= 1 );  //2 is greater or equal to 1
// console.log( 2 < 1 );   //2 is not less than 1
// console.log( 2 == 1 );  //2 is not equal to 1
// console.log( 2 != 1 );  //2 is not equal to 1


console.log(null > 0);  //null becomes 0, so 0 > 0 is false
console.log(null == 0); //null only equals undefined, not 0
console.log(null >= 0); //null becomes 0, so 0 >= 0 is true


console.log(undefined > 0);  //undefined becomes NaN â†’ always false
console.log(undefined == 0); //undefined only equals null
console.log(undefined >= 0); //NaN >= 0 is always false



console.log("2" == 2); //here is == this opereter is coverting string into number and compare


// === this is strick checking 
console.log("2" === 2); //"===" checks for both value and type equality without type conversion.
